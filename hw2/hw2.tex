Let $\TM$ be \textbf{deterministic} Turing machine if not otherwise specified with non-deterministic.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
Say that a non-terminal $A$ in $\CFG\ G$ is \emph{\textbf{usable}} if it appears in some derivation of some string $w \in L(G)$. Given a $\CFG\ G$ and a non-terminal $A$, consider the problem of testing whether $A$ is usable. Formulate this problem as a language and show that it is decidable.
\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
A \emph{\textbf{queue automaton}} is like a push-down automaton except that the stack is replaced by a queue. A \emph{\textbf{queue}} is a tape allowing symbols to be written only on the left-hand end and read only at the right-hand end. Each write operation (we'll call it a \emph{push}) adds a symbol to the left-hand end of the queue and each read operation (we'll call it a \emph{pull}) reads and removes a symbol at the right-hand end. As with a $\mathsf{PDA}$, the input is placed on a separate read-only input tape, and the head on the input tape can move only from left to right. The input tape contains a cell with a blank symbol following the input, so that the end of the input can be detected. A queue automaton accepts its input by entering a special accept state at any time. Show that a language can be recognized by a deterministic queue automaton iff the language is Turing-recognizable.
\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
Show that a language is decidable iff some enumerator enumerates the language in the string order. (\emph{\textbf{String order}} is the standard length-increasing, lexicographic order. See page 14 of the textbook.)
\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
Let $C$ be a language. Prove that $C$ is Turing-recognizable iff a decidable language $D$ exists such that $C = \{ x \mid \exists y \in \{ 0,1 \}^{\ast} ~ (\langle x,y \rangle \in D) \}$. \\
(Hint: You must prove both directions of the ``iff''. The ($\leftarrow$) direction is easier. For the ($\rightarrow$) direction, think of $y$ as providing additional information that allows you to confirm when $x \in C$, but without the possibility of looping.)
\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
Consider the problem of determining whether a single-tape Turing machine ever writes a blank symbol over a nonblank symbol during the course of its computation on any input string. Formulate this problem as a language and show that it is undecidable.
\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
Let $A$ be a language.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Show that $A$ is Turing-recognizable iff $A \leq_\mathrm{m} A_{\TM}$.
	\item Show that $A$ is decidable iff $A \leq_\mathrm{m} \mathsf{0}^{\ast} \mathsf{1}^{\ast}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Let $J = \{ w \mid \text{either } w = \mathsf{0} x \text{ for some } x \in A_{\TM}, \text{ or } w = \mathsf{1} y \text{ for some } y \in \overline{A_{\TM}} \}$. Use mapping reductions to show that neither $J$ nor $\overline{J}$ is Turing-recognizable.
	\item Let $\mathit{FINITE}_{\TM} = \{ \langle T \rangle \mid T \text{ is a } \TM \text{ and } L(T) \text{ is a finite language} \}$. Show that $A_{\TM} \leq_\mathrm{m} \overline{\mathit{FINITE}_{\TM}}$ to prove that $\mathit{FINITE}_{\TM}$ is not T-recognizable.
	\item (harder) Show that $A_{\TM} \leq_{m} \mathit{FINITE}_{\TM}$ to prove that $\overline{\mathit{FINITE}_{\TM}}$ is not T-recognizable.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
Define a \emph{\textbf{two headed finite automaton}} (2HFA) to be a deterministic finite automaton that has two read-only heads that each can move independently \emph{from left to right} on the input tape. The transition function $\delta$ of a 2HFA has the form: $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q \times \{\text{S,R}\} \times \{\text{S,R}\} $. Thus, at each step, the 2HFA can read the symbols under each of its two heads and move each head independently either right (an R move) or let it stay in place (an S move). We also assume that a 2HFA accepts its input by entering one of its designated accept states, regardless of its head positions. Furthermore, a 2HFA can detect when either of its heads are at the right end of the input tape. For example, a 2HFA can recognize the language $\{ \mathsf{a}^{n} \mathsf{b}^{n} \mathsf{c}^{n} \mid n \geq 1 \}$ as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Head 1 skips across any $\mathsf{a}$'s.
	\item Head 1 reads $\mathsf{b}$'s while Head 2 reads $\mathsf{a}$'s.
	\item Head 1 reads $\mathsf{c}$'s while Head 2 reads $\mathsf{b}$'s.
	\item \emph{Reject} if in Stages 2 or 3, Head 1 doesn't finish exactly when Head 2 finishes, or if symbols are ever encounterd out of the order: $\mathsf{a}$'s, $\mathsf{b}$'s then $\mathsf{c}$'s. \emph{Accept} otherwise.
\end{enumerate}
Let $E_{\text{2HFA}} = \{ \langle B \rangle \mid B \text{ is a 2HFA which recognizes the empty language} \}$. Sketch a proof that $E_{\text{2HFA}}$ is not decidable. (Give enough detail to show how your proof depends on the 2HFA model.)
